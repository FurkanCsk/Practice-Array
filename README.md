# C# Array Example

This project demonstrates basic array manipulation in C#. It covers:

Array Initialization: Creating an array of 10 integer values.
Random Number Generation: Filling the array with random numbers between 1 and 50.
User Input: Adding a new value to the array from user input.
Array Sorting: Sorting the array in descending order.

## How It Works
Array Initialization:

The program initializes an array of size 10.
Random values are assigned to each element of the array.
The array is then printed to the console.
Adding a New Element:

The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
A new array is created to accommodate this additional value, and the original array is copied into this new array.
The user's input is added as the last element, and the new array is printed.
Sorting in Descending Order:

The program sorts the new array in descending order.
The sorted array is printed to the console.
